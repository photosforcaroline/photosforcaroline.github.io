            in the weeks leading up to your departure i spent many a night wondering how we would keep loving each other
            the same with 5,430 miles between us -- how i would remember what it felt like to fall asleep beside you, or the familiar smell
            of your neck as i hugged you for the first time after just one night apart. but i realised, no more than a few hours after your plane
            took off for la, that i didn't need any of those things to remember you, or to love you. every day i
            find you intrinsicly woven into the things that i do and the places that i go, and i wanted to document
            each of these occurences -- for you to know that you're on my mind but also for me, as a reminder
            that i still love you and will always love you no matter how far we find ourselves from one another.<br>
            <br>on this website is one picture a day, every day, since the day you left, and a few words explaining
            why each reminds me of you. i can't promise i will have time to update the site daily but i give you my
            word that i will keep taking a photo a day and that i will post them here at every chance
            i get, until the day that we are no longer apart.<br><br><br>i love you sweet girl.<br><br><br>- your buzz

                the time is one minute past midnight on the morning of the 27th. once i've finished writing this caption i will push my code
                online so the website is live and ready for you, and then i'll hit the hay for a few hours before my big travel day. this will
                be the last post i make for a little while. logging off until i see you my love :)

                so sweetly on facetime. luther is next to me, sleeping too, made apparent by his occasional soft twitches
                and grunting snores. i am so content

                i stopped to take a picture of the couple. only after did i notice the title of the book above. i needed a pick me up today,

                there was nothing remarkable about this picture. it was just a guy having his hair cut in peckham,
                long after midnight. it made me giggle so i photographed it. i guess in retrospect it makes me think of you because i realise
                how much i miss these moments. sure, we text every day and we call when we can, but nothing can replace the
                private jokes -- laughing at silly, inconsequential moments with you that aren't noteworthy enough to put the effort
                into typing out but are such an integral part of who we are together and why i love you

                i went to the cinema by myself and saw the french dispatch. i had a great time.
                it's odd how the cinema is something we never really did together but i
                associate it with you so strongly. i guess it is a shared love of ours, maybe i am lamenting
                over how little we indulged in it before you left

                work christmas party (i know, november is early as heck). they signed me up as buzz. i hear the name
                so often now that i barely pay it any thought, but sometimes it catches me off guard and i think of you,
                and how i am your buzz. i barely
                existed as a buzz at all before we met. you aren't just my girlfriend and my best friend,

                this game brings back some of my fondest memories with you, living together for the best part of a month. if we can live together

                most relish a late night trip to the local supermarket; an abundance of goods marked down to mere pennies. i don't, at least not this supermarket
                (sainsburys local opposite the library). their reduced items usually suck and they are awful at monitoring stock levels
                so a bustling reduced shelf most likely implies that every other aisle will be empty, or embarassingly sparse at the very least. i managed to find
                a beetroot salad and some parsnips, which i roasted, and in general i quite enjoyed it. i thought about how you'd have gone into that barren
                wasteland of a shop and somehow gathered the ingredients to whip us up the most delicious meal of my life. you have such a talent for it

                sometimes i can't explain why the thing i photographed made me think of you. it just did, and i think that's
                pretty swell -- how someone can remind you of a feeling and not just a thing

                our first day enduring the time difference. i was up, you were asleep.
                i missed you endlessly and the day was bad in general. at the time seeing reminders
                of you made me the kind of sad that physically hurts in your chest. looking
                back on them now i'm so glad i took pictures and documented them all -- it only
                hurts so bad because we love each other so much. i'm grateful for that
